1. Personal Area Network (PAN)
Definition: A Personal Area Network is a small network, typically within the range of a few meters, designed for personal devices.
Distance: Approximately 10 meters around a person.
Examples:
A smartphone connected to a wireless headset or smartwatch within a short distance.
Bluetooth connections between devices like a laptop and a printer.
2. Local Area Network (LAN)
Definition: A Local Area Network connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a single building or a group of buildings.
Distance: Ranges from 10 meters to 1 kilometer.
Coverage: Can encompass a single room, an entire building, or multiple buildings in close proximity.
Examples:
A home network connecting a computer, printer, and smart devices.
An office network that connects multiple computers and printers within a single building.
3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
Definition: A Metropolitan Area Network spans a larger geographical area than a LAN, typically covering a city or a large campus.
Distance: Generally around 10 kilometers.
Coverage: Designed to connect multiple LANs within a city.
Examples:
A network that connects various branches of a university across a city.
A city-wide Wi-Fi network that provides internet access to residents.
4. Wide Area Network (WAN)
Definition: A Wide Area Network covers a vast geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs and MANs across countries or continents.
Distance: Ranges from 100 kilometers to over 1000 kilometers.
Coverage: Can span entire countries or continents.
Examples:
The Internet, which connects millions of devices globally.
A corporate network that links offices in different countries.
5. Campus Area Network (CAN)
Definition: A Campus Area Network is a network that connects multiple LANs within a limited geographical area, such as a university campus or a corporate campus.
Usage: Typically used by educational institutions or large organizations to facilitate communication and resource sharing among various departments.
Examples:
A university network that connects different buildings and facilities on campus.
A corporate network that links various departments across a business park.
Summary
In summary, networks can be categorized based on their geographical coverage and purpose. PANs are ideal for personal devices in close proximity, while LANs serve local environments like homes and offices. MANs connect multiple LANs within a city, and WANs extend across vast distances, connecting networks globally. Additionally, CANs provide a structured way to connect multiple LANs within a specific area, often used in educational or corporate settings. Understanding these types of networks helps in designing and implementing effective communication systems tailored to specific needs.
