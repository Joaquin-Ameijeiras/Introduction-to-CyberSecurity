Introduction to CyberSecurity

The Internet is a network of networks, is considered a WAN (Wide Area Network) because it spans a vast geographical area, connecting millions of smaller networks, like LAN's (Local Area Network), across the world.
	Any device can connect to a network. It has a MAC address, which serves as the device's ID. When a device connects to a network, it receives an IP address. This can be either a static IP or a dynamic IP assigned by a DHCP server.
	
		IPv4 Address (32 bits):
			It is composed of four groups of numbers separated by dots. Each group can have a value between 0 and 255.
			Example: 192.168.1.1
			
		IPv6 Address (128 bits):
			It is composed of eight groups of hexadecimal characters, separated by colons. Each group contains four hexadecimal characters (0-9 and A-F).
			Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
			
		MAC Address (48 bits)
			It is composed of six groups of hexadecimal characters, separated by colons. Each group contains two hexadecimal characters (0-9 and A-F).
			Example: 00:14:22:01:23:45
